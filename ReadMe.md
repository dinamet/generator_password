Comments and Documentation

This idea was interesting to me, so I chose this project. In general project is not very complex. When I was challenging with writing this code, I have used additional sources. I was trying use the information that we have passed before. 

However I have not figured it out completely yet in IntelliJ idea because there are some moments which were difficult to understand. So does GitHub, but I know that it is very useful and comfortable. It will be necessary in future to know this system and use that.

Thank you for giving this oportunity.
